## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Lokesh9511/air-quality-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: `Air_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`

## Data Analysis

Explore the dataset and perform initial data analysis using the Jupyter Notebook `Air_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`.

## Data Cleaning and Outlier Detection

The notebook includes steps for cleaning the data and detecting outliers in the 'NowCast Conc.' and 'AQI' columns.

## Linear Regression Model

A linear regression model is implemented to predict AIQ based on the 'NowCast Conc.' feature.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Visualization

Various visualizations, including scatter plots, box plots, and histograms, are provided to understand the data and model predictions.

## Dependencies

- NumPy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- dtale (for interactive data exploration)

Install the dependencies using the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
